## Homework - Spring Cleaning

### Code

Perform some app cleanup and finish any assignments from last week that still need some time and attention. We will begin new topics (and homework ðŸ˜€) tomorrow.

### Journal

Since we just finished a week of assignments that were entirely group-based, reflect on the differences between collaborative and solitary coding. How do you approach the planning, design, and writing phases differently when you're working alone vs. in a group? How is source control affected (GitHub)? Which do you prefer? Why? Are there aspects of either/both that you could work on to improve your performance when in either situation?
