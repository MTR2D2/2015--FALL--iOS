## Homework - Mutt Cutts Hits the Road

Extend the functionality of the app we built in class today. Allow the user to enter two cities and reverse geocode them so you can show pins on the map. Adjust the map to fit both pins. Then find the line-of-sight distance between these two cities (in miles) and display that number to the user. Try Providence, RI and Aspen, CO as two cities to test. They are quite far apart, so this will provide a good test for the map region adjustment code.
